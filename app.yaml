    # Note: ${APP_URL} is a magic variable in DO App Platform for the app's public URL. 
    # But since backend and frontend are same app, they share domain. 
    # Backend is usually mapped to /api or similar if on same domain, OR different domains.
    # For simplicity in this config, assuming they are services in same app.
    # Actually, DO App Platform routes requests to services. 
    # We might need to configure routes.
    
# Let's refine routes.
# Usually simpler to have 2 separate apps or configure routes.
# For now, let's just provide the basic spec and user can configure in UI.
